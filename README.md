# Brachyphisis_Signal_Detectors

Detectors created for my Honours thesis to detect sounds produced by Brachyphisis (a type of Katydid in Mauritius)

`detectors/correlate.py` uses correlates a confirmed katydid signal with audio files to detect the katydid.

`detectors/envelope.py` uses the envelope of the signal to detect the katydid.
